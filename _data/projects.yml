  description: This mobile printed housing prototype quickly adapts to any built environment and requirements. The sectional strategy discretizes the residential spaces into mortgages of life. In this autonomous system, 3D printed concrete modules are prefabricated by robotic arms, transported, and assembled on-site. Each slice of the structure is printable and ready to be assembled with the controlled location of sections. The design empowers communities with a holistic technological solution that reduces labor and carbon emissions.

  description: The urban furniture prototypes can easily adapt to any built environment. With low carbon 3D printed concrete technology, structural algorithm optimization, and adopting the robotics fabrication system, Urban Blocks’ form can be positioned and combined for different purposes—single bench, double-side bench, sofas, planters, and variations in-between. The geometry and scale of the mobile units permit easy assemblies to fit the human body. This design aims to empower the communities by prefabricating urban blocks and to open up countless possibilities to populate our public spaces.
